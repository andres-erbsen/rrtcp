** Only works over Tor. \\ \\

\textbf{Stata, next to wall with TV's by the exit to the amphitheater:} \\
UDP works ok.
TCP is unusably laggy for audio.
RRTCP works.
Network: StataCenter

\textbf{Stata Inner Courtyard:} \\
UDP and RRTCP are spotty, TCP does not work almost anywhere.
Network: StataCenter.

\textbf{38-5 lab, Network EECS Conference Rooms:} \\
Everything except plain TCP is totally fine; plain TCP has occasional one-second-ish silence delays.

\textbf{34-5 network EECS conference rooms:} \\
UDP connects and is beautiful; TCP is really spotty -- a lasting 5s delay is oduced every sentence or so. RRTCP is good enough to have a conversation if the laptop is not moving.

\textbf{34-5 network MIT GUEST:} \\
UDP fails to connect, normal TCP fails to connect. TCP over TOR is usable if you are completely still, but crossing from one AP to another creates a 5s delay that persists 30s+. RRTCP is good enough to have a conversation.
